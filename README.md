# Hi 👋, I'm Lars

My name is Lars Helmuth Probst and I’m an IT-Architect @[IBM](https://www.ibm.com) based in 🏔Ehningen. I am a cloud-native enthusiast fascinated by DevSecOps and modern software engineering practices. Besides hands-on delivery, I lead multiple global delivery projects for global systems across the major hyperscalers. Thereby, skill and people development, as well as software-driven change management, are key aspects of the work I do deliver with passion.
